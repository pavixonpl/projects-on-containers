# projects-on-containers
Application is still in process of creating. Currently I'm getting near MVP of backend version. Current deadline is 27.02.
In small words this is simple and small Jira. There are issues with groups and type, and flows with statuses and connections between them. 
You can create issue and change it's status with a flow, you've decieded will be the best one, you can also modify flows with changing connections and adding new statuses.
In some time there will be graphs with architecture and database entities connections.
I'm using .NET 6.0 with Docker, serivice is a gRPC service with CQRS pattern with think of DDD. Database is created with Entity Framework Code-First. 
In near future I will add Identity server 4 and messages on RabbitMQ.
